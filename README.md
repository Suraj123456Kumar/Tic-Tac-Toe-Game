# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a game which has both front-end and backend features. Front-end contain UI, and the logic of the game whereas backend contains database of this game. I have used front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and backend technologies such as Express Js and Mongoose.
